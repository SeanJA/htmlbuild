Sublime users: do I really need to add a new build system to open an HTML file open in a browser? #alreadygoogled #really #textcheckmate

Getting Started
===============

- Install `htmlbuild`

%(package_name)s: https://github.com/SeanJA/htmlbuild

If you're running a full installation of Sublime Text, simply doublelick on the
``.sublime-package`` file. If you're running a portable installation, you need
to perform an `installation by hand`_.

.. _installation by hand: http://sublimetext.info/docs/extensibility/packages.html#installation-of-packages-with-sublime-package-archives

Once installed, you should be able to pick the `htmlbuild` build system and hit your build button (default F7 I think...).
Theoretically it also works when you have just an html file open.

Alternatively, you can define a new key binding for this command.
